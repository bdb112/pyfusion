save_to_local writes timebase in unusually compressed form if reading
 local cache data and if given a multi diagnostic - e.g. the out files
 are hald size (but are complete!) and the warning !!!!!!!!!!!! fixup
 of nans with cumsum !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! us given
This means it is erroneously replaceing cumsum/nans with a fake 2us
 timebase. Normally this is OK, but...
 run -i pyfusion/examples/save_to_local.py  dev_name='W7X' diag_name="['W7X_L5UALL']" shot_list="[[20160310,9]]"  local_dir=/tmp


on IPP server, Langmuir_data can't find Koords on 20160309,42 L53_LP11
      fixed: due to missing coord call in W7X/fetch
20160309,42 channel 13 doesn't look like old channel 15 *~2?? (but
11,12 look like old 13,14

Requests:
add pyfusion.TSTART pyfusion.TSTOP  which can be set by env vars, and
may be seconds or samples (if integers).  Error warning if integers
are < 1000 as it seems a mistake.

a function to increment either style of shot number

python3 Philosopy:  
Only aim for 2.6,2.7 compat, make code in 3 idiom as much as poss.,

for //, avoid import division - but use the // op. This will allow bugs to show up in comparing python 2 and 3 output.

for print, only import print_function in cases when the end= feature is needed.

initially have used a little of six, but maybe python-future is more python 3 oriented.

*** // test using -3 is a runtime test, and will miss unexplored branches of if

raw_input

============  Bugs ===========
LHD access is broken due to Error in LHDConvenience fn  (output_coords)

Need to warn about using restore_sin when the sweep is not clipped -
voltage is increased erroneously.

Partial clipping produces artificially high Te (see odt file)

***** Save_to_local should use (rest of this line lost....)

****** python3 doesn't like the npz files created since around Mar 1 2016?
 Unpickling a python object failed: UnicodeDecodeError('ascii', b'l\x9f\xb5}i[8\x14', 1, 2, 'ordinal not in range(128)')

Works fine on tut data.

**** Not a BUG!  plot_svd runs slowly under python2 - solved if save_wisdom is used!!
takes about 10 sec for first plot - python 3 ~ 1 sec - otherwise same
confirmed for 0.6 c474ee1

Note: previously, for versions before 0.6 c474ee1, use:  start_time=250 "filter=dict(centre=90,bw=30,taper=2)"

******* FIXED c474ee1 problem in merge_test_pyfusion with blank line immediately preceding shot line ******

******** FIXED c474ee1 local cache of .npz data only works in  multichannel data *******

******* FIXED in 0.6 c474ee1 problem since at least b3d5c ********** 
solution was to shift fft before and after integration, check for aliasing
