Bugs to fix:

     timesegments don't save a record of ignored channels, so if channels are ignored it's not clear how to reconstruct i.e. flucstrucs...
     
     core libraries should not depend on modules. In core, SingularValue has ForeinKey to data mining table. wrong. wrong. wrong. 

     not sure how to pickle arrays,  at the moment I'm converting arrays to lists for pickling in sqlalchemny, and then converting bacck to arrays... sureley less efficient

     getting data truncation warnings for fluctruc properties... :S --  need to use precision argument. 

     need to do profiling, code slows down as more flucstrucs are processed...

     in some places the channels are referred to by name rather than id... (in ordered_channel_list in diagnostic, for example) - should use the id everywhere, or a relation
